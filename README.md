This is my java application which emulated a phone book.

To run this this application you will need to have the path in the src folder and follow the next steps:

	Compile the application :  javac Proiect.java
	Run the application: java Proiect

After that the program will load a splashscreen with an image which can serve as an advertise. 
In order to enter in the main part of the application you need to go on "Ajutor" -> "Inregistrare". The application was created with a specific code to register. If you area using a different one the application will close.

The access code is : "java"

After you add the code you can use all the features within the application.
